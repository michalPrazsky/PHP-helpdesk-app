# Helpdesk Application

This helpdesk application allows customers to submit new tasks and view the status of their submitted tasks. Technicians can acquire submitted tasks from customers, then assign them to a technician or take them by themselves. They can edit the task if errors are there or submit a solution and mark the task as completed. Technicians can also use a filter function to filter tasks.
